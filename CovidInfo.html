          <h2> Coronavires Tennessee: Gov. Bill Lee says Tennesseans need 'to double down' </h2>
          <p>While the country waits for a COVID-19 vaccine and as the holiday season has arrived, Governor Bill Lee is reminding Tennesseans to follow the five core actions to help slow the spread of the virus.</p>
          <ul>
            <li> Wear a mask or face covering in public </li>
            <li> Keep 6 feet apart from others not in your household </li>
            <li> Wash your hands frequently </li>
            <li> Sanitize frequently touched surfaces </li>
            <li> Stay home if feeling sick or unwell </li>

          <h2> 'Absolutely remarkable’: No one who got Moderna’s vaccine in trial developed severe COVID-19 </h2>
          <p> Continuing the spate of stunning news about COVID-19 vaccines, the biotech company Moderna announced the final results of the 30,000-person efficacy trial for its candidate in a press release today: Only 11 people who received two doses of the vaccine developed COVID-19 symptoms after being infected with the pandemic coronavirus, versus 185 symptomatic cases in a placebo group. That is an efficacy of 94.1%, the company says, far above what many vaccine scientists were expecting just a few weeks ago. </p>

          <h2> Covid-19 Live Updates: School Policies Shift to Bring Back Younger Children </h2>
          <p> After a summer of uncertainty and fear about how schools across the globe would operate in a pandemic, a consensus has emerged in recent months that is becoming policy in more and more districts: In-person teaching with young children is safer than with older ones, and particularly crucial for their development. In urban districts that have been slow to reopen, that has meant making plans to bring back the youngest students. In parts of the Midwest where school districts were more aggressive about reopening, and where there has been a huge rise in cases in recent weeks, public health officials have prioritized keeping elementary schools open even as they have closed high schools and in some cases middle schools. </p>
