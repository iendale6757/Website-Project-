          <h2> Bitcoin </h2>
          <p>Cryptocurrency Bitcoin hits a new record high of $19,510. Bitcoin climbed to a record, taking less than three years to replicate the euphoric ascent that catapulted the cryptocurrency into the mainstream consciousness. “Bitcoin’s moment has arrived,” said Guy Hirsch, managing director for the U.S. at the trading platform eToro, who cited institutional involvement as one of the reasons for its recent advance. “This rally could still have quite a ways to go.”</p>

          <h2> Walmart Xbox and Ps5 launch fail </h2>
          <p>Users accused Walmart of allowing bots to purchase console restocks today, as is the case with all high-demand online sales days like these. The most common report of purchase today was the following process: Add PS5 to cart – see “We’re sorry. An error has occurred. Please return to your cart” – try again – sold out, complete with “Oh Dear” message. If you’re looking for a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X now, you’ll do well to find one in a bundle. That’ll mean paying a significant amount more than the base price.</p>
